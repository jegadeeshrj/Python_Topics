## For Multithreading ##
Importing Modules:

threading: This module is used to create and manage threads.
time: This module is used to add delays in the execution (simulating work).
Defining a Function:

The function print_numbers takes a thread_name and a delay. It loops through numbers from 1 to 5, sleeping for the specified delay before printing each number.
Creating Threads:

Two threads (thread1 and thread2) are created, targeting the print_numbers function and passing different arguments (names and delays) to each.
Starting Threads:

The start() method is called on each thread to begin their execution.
Joining Threads:

The join() method is called on both threads, which makes the main program wait until both threads have completed their execution.
Output:

The output will show interleaved numbers printed by both threads, demonstrating how they run concurrently.
